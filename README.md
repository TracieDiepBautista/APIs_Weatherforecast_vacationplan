+ WHAT'S THE WEATHER LIKE?
```

    Whether financial, political, or social, data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions 
    definitively. 

    Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals are languages used to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like 
    as we approach the equator?"

```diff
+ Part I - WEATHER
```

    Creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 

    The first requirement is to analyse and visualise to showcase the following relationships:

    * Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
    * Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
    * Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
    * Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


    The second requirement is to run linear regression on each relationship. 
    This time, separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere.

    * Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
    * Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
    * Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
    * Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
    * Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
    * Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
    * Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
    * Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

    explain what the linear regression is modeling and describe any relationships that may have.

+ Part II - VACATION PLANNING
```

    to plan my future vacations. 
    Use jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API for this part.

    * Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from Part I.
    * Narrow down the DataFrame to find my expected weather condition for vacation. 
    * Using Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of the coordinates.
    * Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the **Hotel Name**, **City**, and **Country**.
    * Note: The city data used to generate was based on random coordinates as well as different query times.
